## Installation

Required dependencies:
- Node.js and NPM: You can acquire these dependencies for your operating system at the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org)

1. Use the green '<> Code' button on the [Vehicle Builder GitHub repo page](https://github.com/ant-codes-42/vehicle-builder) to either clone the repo or 'Download ZIP' and extract the contents.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder created in step one.

3. Run the command 'npm i' to install all dependencies.

4. Run the command 'npm start' to initialize the program. The program will run in the terminal window.

## Usage

You will immediately be prompted to 'Create a new vehicle' or 'Select an existing vehicle'. There are three pre-configured options if you select the latter.

If you select the first option, you will be asked to choose a type of vehicle, and then asked a series of prompts to input information related to your vehicle.

Once complete you will be brought to the main prompt interface where you will be given several options.

- Trucks have the option to tow other vehicles.

- Motorbikes have the option to pop wheelies (upon meeting certain road conditions :))

All options are fairly self-explanatory.
